## state-class-tutorial
My code that I wrote after learning from [a post on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-state-on-react-class-components) about managing states in react with components. This is vital to the survival as a React developer. What spawned me onto what to learn this is, a product I am working on, [MERNStackStarter](https://github.com/serafirim/MERNStackStarter), has states and I was confused about what was going on. 

### This is a continuation but with react hooks
Tutorial can be found [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-state-with-hooks-on-react-components). I learned a lot here and will probably need to keep going over this to understand it more so I can reproduce it on my own.
